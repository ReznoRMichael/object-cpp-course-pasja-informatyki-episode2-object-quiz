# Learning Object C++ - Quiz made using OOP
> Training course - Pasja Informatyki, Object C++ course, episode 2 ( [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2BQUXf91ZA) )

## General info
A simple quiz from the [previous repository](https://github.com/ReznoRMichael/cpp-course-pasja-informatyki-episode7-fstream-quiz) rewritten in Object Oriented Programming using Classes, objects (stored in an array) and member functions. A public class variable sets the question number. One function reads questions from the quiz.txt file and saves the lines into variables. Second member function asks the questions by outputting them on the screen and waits for the answer. Third function checks if the answer is correct - if yes, it gives the user a point, if not - it gives no points. At the end the sum of all points gained is shown on screen.
